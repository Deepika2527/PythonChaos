DataType -
A value that a varaible is stored 
what type of data is beinfg stored

why do we need datatype?
to store values
to know what kind od data is being stored
to perform operations


datatypes are classifed into 2 types primitive and non primitive
1. primitive datatype -
single values, immutable
   1. int - integer - whole numbers both +ve and -ve no's, scalar value,precisions
   2. float - decimal values - 3.14, 67.9 , temperatures - electornics
   3. complex - real + imaginary - 5+3j
   4. boolean - bool - True or False

2. Non primitive datatype-
Hetergenous , mutable


Sequence datatypes - which can be accessed by the index,
String - '', "", ''' '''
List - odered ele, Hetergenous, [], acessed by index , mutable, Duplicates are allowed
Tuple- ordred ele , Hetergenous , () ,acessed by index , immutable , Duplicates


Non Sequence datatypes - set 
Becaues there is no order, there is no index, 
MUtable yet we can add or remov the data, Not Allow Duplicates, Hetergenous, {}

dict -
 {} - 
 keyvalue pairs,
  no dulipcate keys are allowed,


  no index

  d= {
    "name" ="Deepika",
    "class" = "Python"
  }




id- memory allocated/ taken by the varaible
type - defines what is the type of the varaible
sys.getsizeof - how much size the varaible will take
